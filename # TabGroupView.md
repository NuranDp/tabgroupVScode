# TabGroupView

TabGroupView is a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you organize open files into named tab groups.

## Features
- Create, rename, delete, and pin tab groups
- Add or remove files (or all files in a folder) to/from groups
- Drag and drop to reorder files within and between groups
- Sort files within groups (manual, A-Z, Z-A)
- Search/filter files across all groups
- Export/import tab group configuration (portable, uses relative paths)
- Merge imported groups/files without duplicates, preserving order
- Open all files in a group

## Usage
- Open the Tab Groups view from the Explorer panel.
- Right-click on groups or files for more options.
- Use the title bar buttons to create, search, export, or import groups.
- Use the context menu or command palette to add files/folders to groups.

## Export/Import
- Export saves your tab groups as a JSON file with relative paths.
- Import merges groups/files from a JSON file, preserving order and avoiding duplicates.
